# Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator
Created by Thomas (@akakrabz), Karan (@Karan-Annam), Renyu (@Renyu-Liu)
## Introduction
Riichi Mahjong has a complicated mechanism of scoring calculation. People often find it hard to calculate points manually. That's why we have introduced Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator. This is a Rust library that calculates the score of a winning Riichi Mahjong hand. It receives a complete input of the winning hand and game state and returns a detailed score breakdown, guiding players to redistribute their points.
## Installation

## Challenges

We face challenges in improving loading speed. We found that the loading time for the tile pool is too long, which is restricted by the image loading speed. We are working on it.

## Reference

Scoring calculation is based on [standard Riichi Mahjong scoring rules](https://riichi.wiki/Japanese_mahjong_scoring_rules).

Yaku check is based on [standard Riichi Mahjong yaku lists](https://riichi.wiki/List_of_yaku).
