# Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator
Created by Thomas (@akakrabz), Karan (@Karan-Annam), Renyu (@Renyu-Liu)
## Introduction
Riichi Mahjong has a complicated mechanism of scoring calculation. People often find it hard to calculate points manually. That's why we have introduced Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator. This is a Rust library that calculates the score of a winning Riichi Mahjong hand. It receives a complete input of the winning hand and game state and returns a detailed score breakdown, guiding players to redistribute their points.
