# Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator
_Created by Renyu (@Renyu-Liu), Thomas (@akakrabz), and Karan (@Karan-Annam) as the final project for [CS 128H](https://honors.cs128.org)_
## Introduction
Riichi Mahjong has a complicated mechanism of scoring calculation. People often find it hard to calculate points manually. That's why we have introduced Riichi Mahjong Scoring Calculator. This is a Rust library that calculates the score of a winning Riichi Mahjong hand. It receives a complete input of the winning hand and game state and returns a detailed score breakdown, guiding players to redistribute their points.
## Installation
### Prerequisites
* **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)** (Required)

* **[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** (MacOS)

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com)** and **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)** (Alternative)
  
### Download & Run

* Download and extract the ZIP file from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Renyu-Liu/Riichi_Mahjong_Scoring_Calculator) or  run `git clone https://github.com/Renyu-Liu/Riichi_Mahjong_Scoring_Calculator.git` in terminal to clone the repository.

The score breakdown includes the total points, fu/han points, and yaku detected. It also guides players to redistribute their points. It will show "No Yaku Found" if no yaku is detected. 

To familiarize yourself with yaku and scoring rules, you may click "Rules" button at top right corner to view them at any time.

## Technical Overview

### Data Structure

<img width="752" height="939" alt="Untitled Diagram drawio" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/215981e1-450e-4c43-9f83-af0fa1036e3d" />

* Tile works as the smallest unit and makes up all related objects.

* Winning Hand and Game Info is the user input.

* Score is displayed the output.

* The program receives Winning Hand and Game Info and returns Score.

### Work Flow

<img width="964" height="1039" alt="flowchart" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5991162-1413-4a28-9ac5-72704ff056c4" />

* Frontend Logic: The program directly handles all possible input conflicts according to Riichi Mahjong rules and guides users to correct their inputs. It ensures the input that sent to backend is recognizable.

* Backend Logic: The program involves multiple decision routes in the backend to detect all yaku, regular and irregular. Based on Riichi Mahjong scoring rules, there must be at least 1 yaku to calculate the score. Key crossroads include the check for hand structure and type of yaku. The final result is calculated based on the number of yaku and fu/han points.

## Challenges

* Some rare yaku with complicated rules are not correctly detected. We are working on it.

* We found that this app has problem running on Windows system due to configuration issues. We are working on it.
